Normalized Budget data for the city of Seattle.

Seattle Open Data denormalizes budget data into individual rows. In order to more easily support applications utilizing budget data, this package presents the data as a tree, following the "Service > Department > Program > Expense" structure that is present for the Operational Budget.

More work will be done to normalize the Capital Budget at a later point.
